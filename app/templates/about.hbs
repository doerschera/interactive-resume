        My name is Aly Doerscher, I'm a frontend developer currently based in Austin, TX. I have a background in art and design and earned a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design before diving into web development. Along the way I discovered that problem solving is what really excites me. I love mixing logic with aesthetics to create elegant and dynamic sites.
        <br><br>
        In my freetime I like to relax with podcasts and knitting, espeically when accompanied by a purring cat and warm light. On top of being a design nerd, I grew up writing and have managed to publish a few poems of my own. Please enjoy some words and color on the house.
